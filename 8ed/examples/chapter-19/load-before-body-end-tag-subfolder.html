	<p>See the HTML code and comments regarding how to load external JavaScript files (from a sub-folder) directly before the <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> end tag.</p>
	
	<!-- For best performance results, load your JavaScript at the very end of your page, right before the end </body> tag as shown below in this page.
	
	The only difference between this page and load-before-body-end-tag.html is that this one loads the JavaScript file from a sub-directory called "js". I recommend organizing your JavaScript files in a folder such as this one; it's a common practice. -->
